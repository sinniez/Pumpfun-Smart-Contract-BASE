Welcome to the Pump/Base.fun smart contract, inspired by Pump.fun. This project is dedicated to emulating the features of Pump.fun, such as managing virtual liquidity providers (LPs), and establishing Uniswap pools. This Solidity/Hardhat smart contract is engineered to operate seamlessly across Ethereum's Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions.

Please understand if your forked code encounters issues. Certain sensitive elements have been intentionally omitted for security reasons, which we refer to as SECRET.

If you're interested in having the Pump.fun smart contract access or have any doubts, please reach out to me through the following contacts:
